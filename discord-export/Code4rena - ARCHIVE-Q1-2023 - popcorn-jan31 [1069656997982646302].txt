Noob question: can we still submit the same issue that was found with the automated finding but it is a different instance that was not posted on the automated findings?

You should ask that outside of this channel (like maybe in the question or warden channel) since thats more general.

nice, no-code solution for web3 🙂 I've worked at one project that had huge no-code solution. Excepts its development took like 5-7 years 😄 
The road to robust and user-friendly no-code product is hard, but in the end it helps to bring much more people in industry. GL to the devs and I hope they will make it

hmm, I'm seeing failures with the quickstart too, that I didn't see before. I see that the sponsor made some test changes - @RedVeil can you take a look at the failures?


[02/01/2023 01:21] illilli000
I just ran `forge test --no-match-contract 'Abstract'` again and got no failures. Perhaps it's an intermittent rpc issue?

[02/01/2023 09:01] 0xredveil
just confirmed it on my build again and it seems to work just fine. But i understand from the conversation that it has been resolved? 🙂


[02/01/2023 12:08] ch_301
@RedVeil 
What is the idea of this modifier? Is this  `permissionRegistry.endorsed(address(1))` will get a default value or the owner can update it?
```
  modifier canCreate() {
    if (
      permissionRegistry.endorsed(address(1))
        ? !permissionRegistry.endorsed(msg.sender)
        : permissionRegistry.rejected(msg.sender)
    ) revert NotAllowed(msg.sender);
    _;
  }
```


[02/01/2023 12:10] 0xredveil
Endorsement can only be changed by the owner. The idea here is that we can switch from a permission model of allowing specific addresses to rejecting addresses.


[02/01/2023 12:11] 0xredveil
The first turnary and the default requires the msg.sender to explicitly be added as an allowed creator


[02/01/2023 12:11] 0xredveil
while later we can switch this and allow anyone to create as long as they have not been explicitly rejected from creating


[02/01/2023 12:14] ch_301
OK, on **STAKING DEPLOYMENT LOGIC** 
```
@notice Deploy a new staking contract. Caller must be owner.
```


[02/01/2023 12:15] ch_301
Why you don't use `onlyOwner` with `deployStaking()`?


[02/01/2023 12:17] 0xredveil
ah damn that natspec comment slipped through


[02/01/2023 12:17] 0xredveil
it should look at `canCreate` NOT `onlyOwner`

Hi all - quick note re: the above discussion between @Ch301 and @RedVeil. We're not going to make any updates to the natspec comment here even though it's clearly causing some confusion, in the interest of respecting our code freeze rules. 

Would recommend though that all participants refer to the above discussion ^^ if you're also confused by the comment. 🙂

The attacks listed under Security section are considered known issues or something?


[02/02/2023 06:08] 0xredveil
No, they should rather help or give a starting idea of potential targets and how to exploit them. All of these things should be save but id hope to findout with this audit if this is really the case.


[02/02/2023 06:08] 0xredveil
Obviously there might be other vectors that I missed. I'd say think of it as a starting point to think about the security of the protocol


[02/02/2023 07:26] t.nero

[02/02/2023 16:36] infamousdegen
what does multiRewardEscrow do , Is it for storing the staking stratergy  rewards temporarily before it is being distributed


[02/02/2023 16:59] 0xredveil
Its an optional contract to escrow rewards from staking and pay them out over time. One could view it as a staking contract with linear distribution


[02/02/2023 17:00] 0xredveil
this allows someone to give out high apy on the staking side but limit market impact by smoothing out the actual amounts getting paid out


[02/02/2023 18:42] d_auditor
Hi @RedVeil. I'm sorry but the flow of the contracts is not really clear. If it is not too much to ask, from the contract that end users interact with, how does the contracts interest with each other


[02/02/2023 19:28] 0xredveil
No worries :). There are three different user types that can interact with it.


[02/02/2023 19:28] 0xredveil
Regular users will just interact with the vault to deposit and withdraw funds

{Reactions}
👍 

[02/02/2023 19:29] 0xredveil
So they can later be cloned


[02/02/2023 19:30] 0xredveil
And creators can create Vaults, adapters and strategies via the vaultcontroller


[02/02/2023 19:30] 0xredveil
Does that make sense? Or does it answer the question?


[02/02/2023 19:37] trustminimised
Is this creators that are permitted by governance? Or governance itself? At a glance this doesn't seem to be permissionless?


[02/02/2023 19:37] 0xredveil
It's not per se


[02/02/2023 19:37] 0xredveil
But we can flip a switch to make it open to everyone that isn't specifically blacklisted


[02/02/2023 19:39] trustminimised
Alrighty. So for the purposes of thinking about the security model here for the contest, I should assume governance controls these VaultController vault/adapter/strategy deployments?


[02/02/2023 23:41] d_auditor
Perfectly. Everything lines up now. Thanks ✌️

[02/02/2023 23:42] 0xredveil

[02/02/2023 23:42] 0xredveil
Sry for the late answer. It should be seen as an open permissionless system.


[02/02/2023 23:43] 0xredveil
The idea of the switch is mainly that we can slowly onboard some first users to test it out. Once we feel comfortable we would flip the switch and allow anyone to interact with it.


[02/02/2023 23:44] 0xredveil
At this point only explicitly denied addresses couldn't. As this is difficult to manage though the assumption should be thst after an initial rollout it's permissionless


[02/03/2023 01:53] 0xtraub
can you give an example of what beefyBooster would be? like maybe an example address


[02/03/2023 10:35] ahmet5611
PermissionRegistry is kinda over-engineered... if only one can be true of endorsed or rejected, couldn't they leave only one boolean that can be true for endorsed/rejected and false for the opposite? 😬


[02/03/2023 10:46] illilli000
if you have suggestions on how to make things more efficient, that'd be something you could flag as a QA or gas issue

[02/03/2023 10:53] 0xredveil
the main idea is that we could switch from endorsement-only to open to everyone but rejected. Id be happy if we can make this simpler though

Mind sharing those? Id be happy to simplify it


[02/03/2023 14:00] 0xtraub
what was the rationale behind the adminProxy? you've already defined all the signatures and interfaces for administration of admin functions but proxying it all through that contract just makes it harder to comb through all the abi encoding/decoding. Having VaultController itself be the owner and do all the calls makes more sense and simplifies significantly.


[02/03/2023 15:41] dadekuma
Hi! Is someone available for DM?


[02/03/2023 15:53] peakbolt
same, looking for someone to DM


[02/03/2023 15:58] 0xtraub
are rug vectors considered in scope @RedVeil? Rugs by users who create vaults/adapters not protocol admins


[02/03/2023 16:11] 0xredveil
The proxy calls make it indeed way harder. The rational for the adminProxy was about upgradeability. If the VaultController would be owner of all contracts and we would swap it out for a newer version we would need to transfer ownership for all contracts in the system. As these include vaults and adapters etc. This could be quite complex and annoying

{Reactions}
👍 

[02/03/2023 16:11] 0xredveil
With the adminproxy we only need to change the owner of the proxy


[02/03/2023 16:11] 0xtraub
that makes sense. fair point.

@RedVeil  Question about https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn#security section, specifically the part `Nominate new owner of the adminProxy to change configurations or endorse malicious templates` which sounds like may be used as "inspiration" to explore potential targets. `AdminProxy` contract is in the scope, but being a proxy is not helpful outside of the context of `OwnedUpgradeable` which is outside of scope. Would be able to clarify?


[02/03/2023 20:20] 0xredveil
i saw it as someone changing it through the VaultController


[02/03/2023 20:20] 0xredveil
but even than they would need to be the owner


[02/03/2023 20:20] rebase3763
same question about in-scoped VaultController''s `pausing logic`


[02/03/2023 20:20] 0xredveil
Owned is simply the synthetix owned contract that has been around for ages


[02/03/2023 20:21] rebase3763
no question there, it is done through the vaultController


[02/03/2023 20:22] 0xredveil
so are your questions answered? or is there still smth? 🙂


[02/03/2023 20:22] rebase3763
maybe I can rephrase, is `pausing/unpausing` in the scope?


[02/03/2023 20:24] rebase3763
and are `ownership change`  through `nominateNewOwner` and `acceptOwnership` in the scope? I may be just reading it too literally 😉


[02/03/2023 20:32] 0xredveil
well pause on Owned contracts arent they are just dependencies from synthetix/oz


[02/03/2023 20:32] 0xredveil
but the usage in the protocol is certainly in scope


[02/03/2023 20:32] 0xredveil
so if i used paused wrong or missed smth there than thats deffo in scope


[02/03/2023 20:35] rebase3763

Hey @RedVeil. What is the reward staking model


[02/07/2023 15:09] d_auditor
Is the user rewards dependent solely on time or amount invested?


[02/07/2023 16:11] 0xredveil
Correct


[02/07/2023 16:11] 0xredveil
People can add arbitrary rewards


[02/07/2023 16:11] 0xredveil
Than define how many token they want to pay out to the stakers per second


[02/07/2023 16:12] 0xredveil
If only one user stakes they get all of it otherwise its shared between all stakers based on their stake amount


[02/07/2023 16:12] 0xredveil
But its always linear


[02/07/2023 16:12] 0xredveil
If you want to adjust the rate you can do it via admin function but than it will again pay them out linearly


[02/07/2023 16:13] 0xredveil
The other option is to set rewardsSpeed to 0


[02/07/2023 16:13] 0xredveil
Than all gets paid out instantly

Glad to have done my first contest attempt on this project :)
But time management felt hard with such a large codebase 😳 
I took too much time trying to find "all" the ins & outs of the issues I found and verifying that my PoC was working as intended.
This led to some neglect in shaping my submitted findings (I hadn't carefully read the submission policy until an hour before closing time 🤡) + not submitting one finding 😔 👆

[02/07/2023 20:35] aitechcoder
I feel you... Got one medium finding I couldn't submit, because I couldn't get the PoC done in time 😦  Maybe should have just submitted it without PoC. Got it working 15 mins after deadline...
